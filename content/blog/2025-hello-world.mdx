Writing helps clarify thinking.

## Software Engineering

- Clean architecture matters
- Scale reveals design flaws
- Simplicity wins long term

> Code is read more than it is written.

```ts
function isClean(code: boolean) {
  return code === true
}
```

```ts {1,4}
function sum(a: number, b: number) {
  return a + b
}

console.log(sum(1, 2))
```
